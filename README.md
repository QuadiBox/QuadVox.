This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project QuadVerse

Project QuadVerse is a personal developmental project, build by a entry-level Front-end developer aiming to perfect and polish his programming skill. This is his first shot at wriiting a README and also Git. 

This website is currently running locally on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) at the time of this writing.

I'm just about to start the project, hopeful it comes out great. Fingers crossed.
